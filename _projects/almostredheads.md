What is the border for people who live there? Do they feel that there is something that separates us? Why do we have borders and what does it mean to cross them? We invite you to join us on our way to the place were our countries meet and to listen to the stories of people from both sides of the border between Latvia and Lithuania.



##Lady from Lietuvas iela

<img src="Lietuvasiela.JPG" alt=""> 

Through the window of the house 33 in Lietuvas iela we saw a nice lady with her black dog. They were looking at us passing by. We said hello and started to talk with her. She could speak both latvian and lithuanian! She was very nice and invited us to come over. She has been living in this house for 59 years. She was born in Latvia, her mother is lithuanian and her father – latvian. She also had a latvian husband who she met in Tervete.

She finished three grades in Jelgava. During war she went to live in Joniškis (Lithuania) with her family. She started to attend lithuanian school without knowing lithuanian language. She only could write in lithuanian, because letters were similar, but when somebody was talking she couldn’t understand. She shared one funny story with us: once her teacher asked her to bring notebooks to school and she understood that she has to bring her sisters. Her sisters were two and three years old back then and mother couldn’t believe that teacher asked for that so she went to school to clear things out. There were more misunderstandings, but, finally, she learned to speak lithuanian as well as she spoke latvian.

She only finished four grades. Then she came back to Latvia. She was working as a chef. After she worked in a hospital for 27 years. She met her husband and she moved to the border were she spent all her life up till now. In the same house also lives her granddaughter with her husband. She also has some relatives in Lithuania (in Šiauliai and in Joniškis) who visit her often. We really enjoyed our time with this woman, we gave her some chocolate, and she offered us cherries. She was very happy that we stopped by. Our first experience with border people was very satisfying and we were encouraged to move forward.

##Lady going to visit her friends

We kept on going further on Lietuvas iela when we saw a lady near the entrance to one of the houses. We greeted her in latvian and asked if she have some minutes. She agreed to talk with us. She was about to visit her friends. We’re talking about what does it mean to live on the border, and she said that it means that you have to respect other nation and you have to learn a couple of words in lithuanian. She doesn’t have lithuanian friends, but she knows that there are a lot of lithuanians who live in Latvia territory. She mentioned the fact that in a past people had a possibility to choose their citizenship if they have parents with different citizenships and live on the border. She also noted that she crosses the border to do some shopping, usually in summertime. She goes to the shops in Joniškis because it’s cheaper and it’s more interesting for her to buy something from the other country. It started to rain while we’re talking so we decided to move on. We said goodbye to the lady and again turned to the street leading closer and closer to the border.

##Children in Eleja tree house

At the very end of Eleja village we saw some children playing near the big three. When we get closer we saw a tree house.
-	Sveiki!
-	Sveiki!
-	You have cool house in this tree!
-	Yes, we know.
They were 8 latvian boys. We started to talk to them and asked do they like to live in Eleja. They said that they like that. Thay didn’t speak Lithuanian, but they knew that there are some lithuanian children who live here. 
-	Do you want candies?
They were a bit shy to say yes, but when we took a big bag of candies from our backpack their eyes started to sparkle 
-	Oh, yes, you are not supposed to take candies from strangers, don’t you?
They were smiling and we just gave candies to everyone. Then the funny part started – I asked if I could climb that tree and they let me do that. Actually they even held leathers for me. That was very sweet. I think I was the first Lithuanian to visit their tree house. Maybe now they will invite Lithuanian children to play as well. We’re braliūkai after all 

We’re walking down the Lietuvas iela for a while...

And we **reached the border!**

##Family on the border
Next we encountered a nice family who were visiting their relatives who live right on the border! They were about to celebrate a birthday of one member of the family. We talked a lot about what does it mean to live on the border with the other country. They explained that it means to have better possibilities to travel and meeting new people it is also an obligation, you can not be ignorant you have to know some words in other language. For them the border is just a part of their road, it is more real then for us who do not live next to the other country.

Viktors was talking with the father who explained that he bought the house in auction – no one wanted to buy it because of a high price. When the price came down he was able to buy it. The family is very mixed – there are lot of people who married lithuanians so they have relatives both in Lithuania and Latvia. He was used to do agriculture and then he got older and he understood that it is not good for his health so he sold the land to one latvian. He was working in Jelgava and he was driving every day from Jelgava to the border. When he needs to buy something like clothes he goes to Jelgava, but for everyday shopping like food, he goes to Lithuania. He likes to visit Lithuania and does that quite often. Border is just a technical thing for him.

While Viktors had a nice conversation with this man I was talking with a young guy who is lithuanian. He says that he loves basketball and he is a huge fan of lithuanian baskatball team, but when it comes to ice hockey he is always cheering for latvians. He also said that they go to Lithuania to do shopping because Joniškis is closer than Jelgava.

Before we said goodbye we asked what chocolate do they prefer: Laima, Karūna or Kalev. They’ve chosen Laima  So that was the last nice moment with people who lives on the border from Latvias’ side.

##Nice lady in Žagarė
When we came to Lithuania we hitchhiked to Žagarė. We asked one lady in Žagarė for directions to the border. She was very sweet and not only showed us a way to the border but also told us about her life – surprisingly her husband was Latvian, she could speak a bit Latvian and she have kids who live in Latvia. Her cousin lives in Latvia as well. Kids visit her and go to Lithuania for shopping. She rewarded us with an unforgetable smile and we continuoed our journey.

##Couple on their bikes
We went to the border and we met two persons riding bikes. They we’re coming back from the forest where they were collecting berries. They live together in Žagarė. They go to Latvia only to the forest. They were living in Latvia for 1,5 years but they don’t speak latvian. While we were talking I found out that they know my grandparents! What a small world! That was a really nice coincidence. We wished each other good luck and exchanged with chocolate and berries 

##Our host Viga and her mother
Viga was our host for the night that we spent in Lithuania. She lives in Stungiai, it’s three kilometers from Žagarė. We spend a great evening together, she was very hospitable, she made us dinner and gave a good accomodation. Moreover she entertained us with her stories and we we’re amazed by her vitality, energy and openness.

The last morning before we came back we had this feeling that it’s really over. We reached our goal and now we’re ready to come back. But what our journey was about? Now when we look retrospectively, we understand that our journey was now about reaching border or even crossing it. It was all about people we met, who lived on this “nationally blured” place. We haven’t felt any difference while being in Latvia and Lithuania! People on both sides were nice to us, we saw that our nations are really close to each other, that many of those, who live near the border, create international families and have good relationships with their neighbours. Or we should say – brothers 

There are many ways to discover our culture and ourselves, but the best way is to share your story with others. We really appreciate every moment of our trip, every person who we met on our way, all those who drove us when we were hitchiking and those with whom we were staying. We say a big thank you for all!
