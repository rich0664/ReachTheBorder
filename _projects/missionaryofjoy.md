Video shows our amazing journey to the border side of Latvia and Estonia, where two cities without any physical border coexist side by side. Valka/Valga are cities that unite two countries and people speaking different languages. In the video we try to answer the questions about the borders and their non-existence. Does not existence of the border between countries change anything? Is it different than before? Do people feel any benefits, living so near or even on the border of the country?  We try to answer those questions putting the answers from our interviews on the pictures from our journey that goes together with the answer.
