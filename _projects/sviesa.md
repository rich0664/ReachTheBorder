# Šviesa

Everywhere in the world we encounter the limits. Walls - the boundaries of our home. Marks on the road - the permitted limit of movement. And every time the border tell us about where  something ends and another begins. But in addition to outside borders there exist personal internal borders of each of us. They are expressed in our behavior, attitude and in interaction with the world around us and with ourselves. The borders of the individual - it is what acceptable to us, and what is unacceptable. 

When our team finally chose the direction of Liepaja, we have been discussing the phenomenon of the sea as a border. But when we came to the city, spent a few hours there, we realized that we have chosen a wrong direction. People were living near the sea for centuries, and for them it is only a part of their lives. What is more important - every time enyone comes to a new place, he or she has to violate their internal borders. So we decided to explore the city individually and write down your thoughts about our internal borders, and what happens to them during the change of locations.

<p id="nastja">Here are my associations to the word “border” - I made a short list of associations in alphabetical order. And in the result I have a very little project, association alphabet that can tell you where I found the concept of border in Liepaja. </p>


<h3>B – Bridge </h3>
I rarely thought that the bridge is a peculiar frontier. Bridges are always borders between two banks. But at the same time bridge connects two banks. The Oskars Kalpaks Bridge is the swing bridge built in 1906 in Karosta, one of the oldest bridges in Liepāja and Latvia. <img src="1.jpg"> The design of the bridge was after French engineer Alexander Gustav Eifel drawings. Karosta itself was constructed in 1890-1906 as a naval base for the Russian Tsar Alexander III and the Oskars Kalpaks Bridge was kind of a border between the city and a naval base. During the Soviet times, one needed special permits to cross the bridge. Military ships and other vessels used the canal, because one of the military bases in the USSR was sited here. <img src="1o.jpg">
<h3>C – Couchsurfing </h3>
Before the trip we decided to try couchsurfing and find host in Liepaja. Couchsurfing  is a hospitality exchange and social networking website. We found a host, Aivis, he hosted us three for two nights. I know that for Germans and Gabija it was their first couchsurfing experience, but not for me. Aivis lives alone with the 8-months dog. <img src="2.jpg">. Aivis gave us keys and said that we can leave and come back at any time we want. It was the first host in my couchsurfing experience who made this. And I was thinking about how couchsurfing influences inner border of a person. You should be very open and ready to the fact that somebody will cross the border of you house and will use your plates for cooking, for example. 
<h3>E – Emmigration </h3>
During soviet times, Liepaja was the most western city, here was the border of the USSR. And many people were emigrating from here to different countries. Emigration is one of the types of crossing the border, but people decide in that case to cross the border of their country not temporarily, but forever. <img src="3.jpg"> To the building, which was constructed in 1772,  where now the recreational centre “Libava” is located, ships arrived for customs control through the Trade Canal. Illegally or not, people were coming here to have an opportunity to escape from the USSR.  For example, a Transatlantic ferry line “Liepaja – New York – Halifax” was opened in 1906 and many people were using this opportunity for emigration. <img src="3o.jpg">
<h3>H – Hitchhiking </h3>
From Liepaja to Sigulda we decided to hitchhike. <img src="4.jpg"> Hitchhiking is a means of transportation that is gained by asking people for a ride in their auto or other road vehicle. Actually, it was my first hitchhiking experience ever.  And I can defenetelly say that this experience ruined my inner borders and different prejudices about that kind of travelling. Hitchhiking makes you very mobile, all you need is time and your bagpack. Sorry, one more thing – you need to be open-minded and ready for adventures. No more tickets bought in advance, I will try to use hitchhiking as much as I can, cause life happens when you are not planning something, but when you are living in the moment. 
<h3>K – Karosta </h3>
Karosta (Naval Port) – the largest historical military territory in the Baltic, occupies approximately one third of the total area of the city. It is a part of Liepāja city which during the Soviet period was a closed territory, inaccessible even to the civilians of Liepāja, so there was, lets call it so, the border between the city and Karosta. <img src="5o.jpg"> Karosta was constructed in 1890-1906 as a naval base for the Russian Tsar Alexander III and Nicholas II was the last Emperor of Russia. Later it served as a base for the Soviet Baltic Fleet. The present Military Port is a special district. It is no longer an army town, but a unified touristic site, inspiring creative people. <img src="5.jpg">

<h3>M – Moll </h3>
Moll for an ordinary person is the distance that he or she can walk on foot away from the seashore. (6 moll old) And it feels as if you are walking on the water – if you stand on the edge of the moll, there is only sea around you, and moll is the border between you and the sea. Every time I travel to some place where is the sea I try to find the moll and spend some time alone on that border between the sea and me. <img src="6.jpg">
<h3>P – Prison </h3>
Prison is the place where freedom ends, at least some aspects of freedom. The two-story building from red bricks is a former Navy Hospital Complex, which was built during period 1896-1904. <img src="7o.jpg"> From July 1905, this place was used as a short time disciplinary penalty place for navy sailors and non-commissioned officers. The worst and the most bloody time for the Guardhouse of the Liepāja Naval Port was that of the Nazi occupation years during World War II. Death penalty by
shooting was the only sentence of the court.  the victims were buried in a mass graveyard nearby. It is estimated that the burial-ground contains the remains of about 90 victims. In 1957, the place was evened and a football ground for the sailors was arranged there. Now there is a museum, but anyway the place leaves very strange feeling inside – you are not a prisoner in that prison, but you want to escape as soon as possible. <img src="7.jpg">
<h3>R – Religion </h3>
I must begin with the statement that I am not a religious person. In my childhood, I was baptized in the Orthodox Church. I do not go to church and do not celebrate religious holidays. From time to time, I visit churches, mostly as sightseeing places, and I feel uncomfortable there. But in Liepaja, in the Karosta region, I decided to go inside of the church, it was Saint Nicholas Maritime Orthodox Cathedral. Erection of the cathedral began in May 1901. The first service in Saint Nicholas Cathedral and church consecration took place on 23 August 1903. Еhe Russian Tsar Nicholas II and his family and courtiers took place in this ceremony. <img src="8o.jpg"> I went inside that huge building and come up to the old woman that was staying in the corner and praying. I have never done it before, I prefer not to talk with parish people in the church. I asked her several questions, she answered, we were talking very silently, she told me some facts about the history of the church, described her personal way to God and asked me some questions. These questions made me cry, I do not know why. I will not write here what we were talking about, but that conversation gave me a lot, somewhere inside me I crossed some border. <img src="8.jpg">
<h3>S – Sea</h3>
With sea, I think, is everything clear – the border between ground and water. <img src="9o.jpg"> And every time I come to the sea, I feel this border while I am staying on the edge of sand and waiting for the wave. <img src="9.jpg">

##Gabija

<p id="gabija">In a dictionary one of the meanings of the word Border is: the part or edge of a surface or area that forms its outer boundary. This meaning had followed us during all the way to Liepaja and back home and became the object of our own reflections of a topic. </p>

“Reach the Border“ or better firstly understood “Where the hell the border is?!..”. It is difficult to reach the things that you do not understand or do not realized existing. To find out it and finally cross the Border – that was the thing we started our little trip to the city where the wind is said to be born, to Liepaja.
How the life without any single boundary would looks like? Would be easy or relieving from fear, uncertainty and insecurity? Before explaining others’ boundaries we all should answer for ourselves: so what it my own personal boundary. Does it makes me secure, does it makes me feel alive and free? Like the birds up our heads, like the sky above us?
The first and the most visible symbol of border became the sea which borders Liepaja as the territory. But what is actually the see for people who live near it?  In my view, for some people, who come to this city as a tourists and casual travelers, the sea is a big pleasure. For others, not seeing the border of the sea and being amazed by its greatness brings the fear of the sea. For fishermen’s and souvenirs shops, coffee’s owners, the see is the only one and the most important income recourse. But for all of them, the see is a part of their everyday life that could never be the same without that border line of the see in the distance.
The see attracts us. Not matter what we are doing, how often we have opportunity to interact with it. The sea has the powerful affect for us. It is freedom, it is uncertainty, and it is unpredictable nature and undiscovered its deepest secrets and world.


As mentioned above, all three of us decided to make an experiment and to discover the city by ourselves. What is about me, I was trying to see through abandoned houses and crumbling walls, through the city that is created and existing for “others” but at the same time through the city that is known as 3rd biggest Latvian city, through the eyes of its native citizens. 
So during this trip I realized and understood the border as:


*	The first our group hitchhiking experience and extinction of communication borders. The feeling of gratefulness for the persons who has no necessity to go out of his initial travel destination but who decides to say “”Let’s in!’’ for completely strangers.
*	Trying to convince myself and hardly searching for the common answer what the sea as boundary really means. But still I felt no descripted feeling to connection with it and take part of its calmness after long and tiring day. 
*	The smile in face when decided to ask for a way back and except the location I got back the accompaniment out of the shop and friendly gesture “More? More…(in Russian, the sea)”. It seems that the see is the answer to all kinds of worries, difficulties and problems. 
*	The abandoned and forgotten part of the city that although it is not so visible or appreciated is a part of its existence. 
*	The keys in our hands. Would you be enough crazy and free to give me your home key; just now, without knowing me better? Just having this small piece of text and my word? Our host in Liepaja was. He gave us his home key for us. Just like that. I am considering, what is the boundary for this person? Maybe your deep and sincere smile which (can) cross all kinds of boundaries?
*	The little puppy and its own boundary life in our host home that reminds me home and the boundaries of owing this little miracle that only love and care can solve.
*	And the way to our own boundaries.
Finally, what is boundary for you? This is the question that does not have the true and simple answer. But which is amazingly interesting and curious to discover.

<h4>What is the border?</h4>

<p id="germans">Every day we need to cross the border, for example, you need to get up out of your bed, sometimes  it is very difficult for a lazy person. But we need to cross it, maybe now or later to develop personal attributes, because if you do no have a problem or goal your life is boredom, but if something happens in your daily life, for example, someone writes in facebook and asks: ,,Do you want to participate in the project, where you need to explore Latvian country borders”. One my friend told me:,,You can find lots of excuses not to do exercises, but only one reason to do the task’’.</p>

I am from Latvian Valka city, which bordered with Estonian city Valga and I traveled to other Latvian city, which bordered with sea- Liepāja.
In Liepāja I felt little bit strange, becauses in Valka I could listen lots of estonian voices, but in Liepāja lithuanians voices and both countries you could listen russian language. Valka and Valga looks like one city in two coyntries and you do not feel borders, but in Liepāja I found many military objects, where no one could go, but I could go to the museum, which have been a prison in Russian empire and Soviet Union time and nobody escaped from Karaosta prison. In Valka/Valga I  did not feel the border, but in Liepāja I saw warships and military base, which could be crossed only by soldiers or officers.

<img src="g1.jpg">

In Soviet Union times one of Liepāja population area (Karaosta) was military base and in Liepāja lived lots of soldiers and officiers.
Nowadays, Karaosta is one of populated areas, where lives people, but their infrastructure aren’t so developed, it looks the same as in Soviet Union times. I think you can enjoy atmosphere  in Karaosta, because when I crossed the bridge to Karaosta I felt strange it looks the same as in Soviet Union time. It is difficult to explain strange atmosphere, but I suggest you to visit Karaosta and enjoy that atmosphere, maybe you will find your inspiration.
