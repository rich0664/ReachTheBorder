Today we started to organize our journey. We decided to discuss everything while walking so we left our hostel and went to Sigulda. On the road we understood that it’s the first time for us as a team and that we can look how do we feel with each other. We started from discussing how we’ll start conversations with people and how we’ll make a good contact with them so we learned some Latvian phrases and thought about some sweet presents for those who will share their stories with us. 

So what do we really want to discover on our way? We thought that it would be interesting to compare opinions from the both sides so we’ll not just reach the border but cross it as well! We also found out that one of us have some relatives on the other side so we have the opportunity to stay with them and feel what does it really mean to live between two countries. These are questions, which came to our minds:

What does it mean to you to live on the border of Latvia/Lithuania?
Do you think there are some differences between people who live on the each side of a border?
When you meet people “from the other side” in which language do you greet them?
What role your nationality plays to you?
Try to imagine the world without any borders. How would it look like?
Do you go to Lithuania/Latvia to do your shopping or for any other reason?
How do you feel about currency which was recently changed in Lithuania?
How accurately could you draw the line between Latvia and Lithuania?

And the most important question...
What chocolate do you prefer: Kalev, Laima or Karūna? ☺

That’s it for today.
Have a pineapple evening everyone!
