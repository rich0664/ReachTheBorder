title: The city where the wind is born
---

### by: Šviesa

We are Germans (from Latvia), Anastasia (from Belarus) and Gabija (from Lithuania). And tomorrow we will start our trip to Liepāja to explore the border there.The first question that comes to our minds - what is the border for people who live in the city with no actual border? The only border for them is the sea line. Does it make our research easier? Not really. Our sleeping bags, flashlights, comfortable shoes, raincoats, energy and enthusiasm are pretty good packed for the upcoming adventure.  We are very excited and looking forward for this trip to the city where the wind is born!
