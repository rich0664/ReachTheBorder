### by: missionary of joy

So the first day of the project has been gone. None border has been reached yet. People seem to be nice and food is good- project should be good with those settings. Even though the most important part is yet to come, I can feel that everyone is adventurous and ready to give the best for the project. I really love the main idea of the project, border question and that it is about hitchhiking and team work. What do I expect from it? I would love to see new places, meet fantastic people on the way and exciting hitchhiking and couchsurfing experience. And I would'nt like to freeze. No freezing,please!
