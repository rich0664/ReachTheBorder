title: Making Blog posts with Prose.io

So, what's going on.
I've been working on this stuff for a bit now and i'm almost done :)
At the moment i'm trying to figure out a good way to give others access to the blog. Since i'm using fairly dev-friendly tools it's a bit hard to make blog posts by default. However this seems like a fairly good solution. I just have to teach her to use
{% highlight html %}
<!-break->
{% endhighlight %}
in order to stop the post teasers in the right spot.
Hopefully that won't be too difficult.
adding images should be self-explanatory
