<p>We are group of young people from Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia and Belarus, who with a help of Erasmus+ funding got a chance to discover Latvian borderline and its hidden treasures. During the youth exchange project „Reach The Border” (23.07.15.-02.08.15.) 23 young people came to Sigulda to share their love for travel and discovery, challenge themselves, learn about each other and work as a group with one aim – to travel to different borderline parts of Latvia by bus or hitchhiking, to camp or stay with locals and make a research about the people they encounter, to learn what the border means for them and how they are living there. </p>
<p>Our group was divided in seven teams, with three members in each, who went to Daugavpils/Zarasai, Eleja/Žagarai, Liepāja, Ventspils, Kolka/Roja, Ainaži/Ikla and Valka/Valga. We explored the borders with Lithuania, Estonia and even the sea, which nowadays does not seem like a border anymore in people minds. </p>
<p>During our travels we saw that there are so many different borders. Physical borders are between one country and another, as a fence between one house and the neighbouring one, as a line you need permission to cross. Even if nowadays these borders between Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia are not there anymore, it is easy to cross them and sometimes even hard to notice that you have arrived in a new country (only road quality changes..). Even the sea is open for everyone; but talking with older locals we saw that it was not always like this. Did you know that even to get to the seaside, for example, at Roja, you needed a special permission? Today, if you ask younger people, they do not think any more about this line where land meets sea as a border and it is only an opportunity to fish or to swim. </p>
<p>Today when physical borders are gone between sea, Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia, they are visible only in language where it becomes the most important border between two groups of people. Like it was in Valka/Valga situation where mobility in city is easy but people still are separated in two groups because of language differences. We observed that on the borderline locals feel responsibility to know both languages because it is a way to show respect. The language border was possible to see also in Daugavpils where one of the locals even described the people as something different to other citizens of Latvia because of the language differences. Also in Zemgale children used language as a reason for division between two children groups – Latvians and Lithuanians.</p>
<p>But while we were searching for borders we found out how flexible they are and how well the cooperation can be created. In border between Latvia and Lithuania locals talked about their belonging to a country and as an example used sports. If they are watching hockey, they will go for team of Latvia, but while watching basketball, they will go for Lithuania. </p>
<p>The border is not just a fence between groups of citizens. People on borderline have relatives on both sides of border; many of them knew both languages or were born on the other country. </p>
<p>When locals were asked about the border crossing, usually they emphasised that they are going after something on the other side and there always was one thing that the other side of border had better than here. For example, people went for shops, saunas or some special food that is very good or just cheaper than on their side.  The border still exists in people minds because they know, that they arrive in a different land that is not theirs, they arrive in a different group, where they do not feel themselves as belonging, but the many opportunities other side brings is a reason for mobility and destruction of borders. However raising mobility becomes a reason for migration when the young people decide to leave the land of their parents and search for opportunities in bigger cities; therefore the villages and smaller cities of borderline were mostly inhabited with old people. </p>

<h2>So how were we travelling?</h2>

<h3>Team Almost Redheads</h3>
<p>this team travelled to Eleja (LV) and Žagirai (LT) so they even crossed the border, learned about the division and cooperation between Latvians and Lithuanians and wrote a story with pictures of locals. </p>

<h3>Team Nebepriskiškiakopūsteliaudiavome</h3> <h6 class="subheader">(yes, it is the longest word in Lithuanaian)</h6>
<p>they chose the part of Latvia where the border between sea and land meets with the border between Latvia and Estonia. They met people in villages that became a source of interesting photos (Even though the cameraman managed to mess up 3 of the 5 important photos). </p>

<h3>Team Golden Eagles</h3>
<p>their road went to Roja and Kolka where they saw the meeting point of two seas and the land. During discussions with locals they learned about migration and the borderline in history that allowed collecting diverse stories and creating videos with interviews. </p>

<h3>Team V.M.A.</h3>
<p>this team used a chance to learn more about Ventspils, borderline with a sea and talked with locals and tourists in this city to make pictures and even drawings about their impressions. </p>

<h3>Team Šviesa</h3>
<p>this teams road went to Liepāja where they looked not only on the border between land and sea, but also looked deeper for the borders in their own minds. </p>

<h3>Team Sunny-Bunnies</h3>
<p>this team made the long travel to Daugavpils and learned how warm and welcoming are the people in this region. They have made pictures and video from interviews.</p>

<h3>Team Missionary of Joy</h3>
<p>the team decided to cross Vidzeme and go to Valka/Valga to talk with locals and observe how one city can be divided by two nationalities. They have made pictures and video story about their trips with statistics of their travel.</p>
